title: Debugging subgraph requests from Apollo Router or Gateway

tags: [federation, gateway, router]

Both the [Apollo Router](/router) and [Apollo Gateway](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup) serve as an entrypoint into your [federated graph](/federation), and as your graph grows you may need to debug a problematic query for one reason or another. 

Each client request goes through a process called [Query Planning](/graphos/explorer/additional-features/#query-plans-for-supergraphs) which generates the subgraph requests that will be executed. It's possible to log the out the query plan in both the Gateway and Router.

## Outputting query plans with headers
With [the Apollo Router](/router/) `v0.16.0+` and [`@apollo/gateway`](/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/) `v2.5.4+`, you can pass the following headers to return the query plans in the GraphQL response extensions:

* Including the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental` header returns the query plan in the response extensions
* Additionally including the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental-Format` header with one of the supported options changes the output format:
  * A value of `prettified` returns a human-readable string  of the query plan
  * A value of `internal` returns a JSON representation of the query plan

## Log Apollo Router subgraph calls

If instead you want to debug your subgraph HTTP requests in an Apollo Router instance, we'll leverage [Rhai](/router/customizations/rhai) to log the necessary information out. An example Rhai script is below. 

**Note that while it is possible to log out the variables, Apollo strongly recommends not doing so to avoid leaking sensitive information into your logs.**

```rhai
fn subgraph_service(service, subgraph) {
  service.map_request(|request| {
      log_info(`Subgraph: ${subgraph} Query: ${request.subgraph.body.query}`);
  });
}
```

The above uses an inline closure within the `map_request` function of the `subgraph_service` hook to log the subgraph-related information. 

To enable query plans, you will need to run the Apollo Router with the `--dev` flag and leverage [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox) to [display your query plans](/graphos/explorer/additional-features/#query-plans-for-supergraphs). 

As an alternative to using `--dev`, you can also enable query plans via the below configuration option, however we **strongly** discourage this as the feature may be removed or renamed at any time in the future.  

```yaml
plugins:
  experimental.expose_query_plan: true
```


## Log Apollo Gateway subgraph calls

To debug queries to your subgraphs within an Apollo Gateway instance, we'll leverage a [`buildService` function](/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/#configuring-the-subgraph-fetcher) to log the operation name and body. 

**Note that while it is possible to log out the variables, Apollo strongly recommends not doing so to avoid leaking sensitive information into your logs.**

```ts
class DebugDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  willSendRequest({ request }: GraphQLDataSourceProcessOptions<Record<string, any>>): void | Promise<void> {
      console.log(`Operation name: ${request.operationName}`);
      console.log(`Query body: ${request.query}`);
  }
}
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  debug: true,
  supergraphSdl,
  buildService({ url }) {
      return new DebugDataSource({ url })
  },
});
```

The above snippet will create a new class called `DebugDataSource` to log out the operation name and body using the `willSendRequest` hook which is called prior to execution. 

Lastly, it also enables the `debug` setting on the Gateway configuration to print out query plans in the logs for further debugging if needed.

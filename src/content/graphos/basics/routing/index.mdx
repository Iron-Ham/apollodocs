With supergraph architecture (also known as [Apollo Federation](/federation/)), each component service is known as a **subgraph**. A **router** acts as an entry point to your subgraphs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with. Clients send operations to your router's public endpoint instead of directly to your APIs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Subgraph A];
  subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

The router intelligently executes each incoming client operation across the appropriate combination of subgraphs. It then merges subgraph responses into a single response for the client. You can configure your router's error handling, CORS settings, other security features, and more. Your configuration options depend on your router type.

## Router types

With GraphOS, you can [host your own](./self-hosted) **Apollo Router**, a configurable, high-performance routing runtime packaged as a standalone binary:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  serviceB[Subgraph A];
  serviceC[Subgraph B];
  router --- serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

Or you can choose for Apollo to provision a **cloud router** for you:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Apollo Cloud"
    router(["Router"]);
  end;
  subgraph YourInfra["Your infrastructure"];
    subgraphA[Subgraph A];
    subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  classDef padding padding-left:1em, padding-right:1em
  YourInfra:::padding
  class clients secondary;
```

The cloud router uses the same Apollo Router binary. If you use a cloud router, you can choose run it on shared or dedicated infrastructure. Running it on dedicated infrastructure offers more configuration options. Continue reading for a detailed comparison of your router options.

<Note>

Apollo also offers the [`@apollo/gateway`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v1/gateway/) library, but we recommend the Apollo Router over `@apollo/gateway` because it provides significant performance improvements. For more information about differences, see the [migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/migrating-from-gateway/).

### Router comparison

Apollo offers the following router options, in increasing order of configurability:

Somes organizations might need to use Cloud Dedicated or self-hosted routing instead of shared cloud routing for these reasons:

- **Compliance.** All of your supergraph's components must be hosted in a particular region to adhere to compliance requirements.
- **Performance.** You need to minimize latency between your router and subgraphs by enabling them to communicate _without_ traversing the public internet (e.g., by hosting all components in a VPC).
- **Customization.** You need to customize your router's behavior beyond what's currently possible with cloud routing

With the exception of Apollo-managed routing, self-hosted supergraphs benefit from all of the same GraphOS features as cloud supergraphs: metrics reporting, schema checks, the Explorer, etc.

If you are interested in either Cloud Dedicated or self-hosted routing, don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales/).

## Setup and configuration

For setup and configuration instructions, refer to the respective router documentation:

- [Cloud router on shared infrastructure](./cloud)
- [Cloud router on dedicated infrastucture](./cloud-dedicated)
- [Self-hosted router](./self-hosted)

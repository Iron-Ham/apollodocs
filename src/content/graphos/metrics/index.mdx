title: Metrics and insights in GraphOS
description: Understand your supergraph's usage and performance
---

GraphOS Studio offers a performant and intuitive UI to help you monitor and understand your supergraph's usage and performance.

## Metrics collection and forwarding

To analyze operation metrics in GraphOS Studio, you first need to report them to GraphOS. If you have a [cloud supergraph](../quickstart/cloud), its router automatically reports operation metrics. If you have a [self-hosted supergraph](../quickstart/self-hosted), you need to [connect your router to GraphOS](./sending-operation-metrics) to report metrics. Apollo also offers a [Datadog integration](./datadog-integration) to forward your graph's performance metrics to your Datadog account.

> Connecting a self-hosted router to GraphOS and forwarding metrics to Datadog are only available for [Enterprise plans](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/).

## Insights and analysis

Once you've configured your graph to send operation and field metrics to GraphOS, you can examine them from any variant's **Insights** page:

The Insights page offers:

- A collapsible left sidebar that acts as a paginated index of your graph's operations and fields
  - You can search, filter, and sort operations and fields
- An operations overview
  - You can adjust the overviews timeframe and filter it to specific clients
- Individual and overall operations performance metrics, including request rate and latency
- [Resolver-level traces](./operations#resolver-level-traces), if you've configured them
- Field usage metrics

Refer to the [Operations metrics](./operations) and [Field usage](./field-usage) pages to learn more about these metrics and how you can use them to optimize your graph's performance.

## Notifications and alerts

Beyond actively monitoring the Insights page, you can also configure GraphOS to notify your team about changes to your graph and its performance. Check out [Setting up GraphOS notifications](./notifications/notification-setup) to learn more.

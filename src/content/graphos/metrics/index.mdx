title: Metrics and insights in GraphOS
description: Understand your supergraph's usage and performance
---

GraphOS Studio offers a performant and intuitive **Insights** page to help you monitor and understand your supergraph's performance.
Once you've configured your graph to send [operation](./sending-operation-metrics/) and [field usage metrics](./sending-operation-metrics#reporting-field-usage) to GraphOS, you can examine them from any variant's **Insights** page:

The Insights page offers:

- An operations overview
- A left sidebar for searching, filtering, and sorting operations and fields
- Detailed operations performance metrics
- Field usage metrics
- Error metrics
- [Resolver-level traces](/operations#resolver-level-traces), if you've configured them

Refer to the [Operations metrics](./operations) and [Field usage](./field-usage) pages to learn more about these metrics and how you can use them to optimize your graph's performance.
Beyond actively monitoring the Insights page, you can also configure GraphOS to notify your team about changes to your graph and its performance. Check out [Setting up GraphOS notifications](./notifications/notification-setup) to learn more.

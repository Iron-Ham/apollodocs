title: Operation metrics in GraphOS
description: Understand your operation performance
---

Once you've configured your graph to send [operation metrics to GraphOS](./sending-operation-metrics/), you can analyze them in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content) from any variant's **Insights** page:

  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"
/>

This page combines operation and field metrics and is broken into two main sections:

- The collapsible left sidebar, where you can [search, filter, and sort operations](#operation-metrics) and fields. Refer to [Field usage](./fields-usage) for more information on field metrics.
- The main insights view, which displays an [**Operations Overview**](#operations-overview) and overall [request metrics](#request-metrics), like the [**Request Rate**](#request-rate).

  - When you click an operation name from the left sidebar or the overview, this view refines to show [detailed information](#operation-details) about the individual operation.
  - You can always return to the overall view by clicking **← Back to All Operations** in the upper right.

  />

## Operations overview

The **Operations Overview** is top and center on the **Insights** page because it summarizes your supergraph's recent usage and performance. It includes the median, range, and percentage change for:

- The **rate of requests** sent to your router
- Your supergraph's **p95 service time**
- Your supergraph's **error percentage**

Beneath each of those metrics, you can also see the individual operations with:

- the highest request rates
- the slowest p95 service time
- the highest error percentage

<img

  className="screenshot"

/>

> The blue **M** icon (Ⓜ️) next to an operation name indicates its a mutation.

You can click an operation name to view more [detailed information](#operation-details) for it. You can also filter the overview by timeframe and client in the top right corner.

/>

More overall [request metrics](#request-metrics) are directly below the overview.

## Operation metrics

By default, the left sidebar shows all operations, but you can use it to hone in on certain ones.
Specifically, you can:

- Search for a particular operation by its name or fields' names
- Filter operations by their type (queries, mutations, subscriptions) or whether they are unregistered or unnamed

<img
  src="../img/operation-sidebar-search-filter.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"

/>

- Sort operations (descending or ascending) by:

  - Total requests (count)
  - Request rate in requests per minute (rpm)
  - Total error (count)
  - Error rate
  - Error percentage (%)
  - Cache hit percentage (%)
  - p50 Cache TTL in seconds, minutes (s, min)
  - p50, p90, p95, and p99 service time in milliseconds, seconds, or minutes (ms, s, min)
  - Total duration in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours (ms, s, min, hr)
  - Signature size in bytes (B, KB)

As with the **Operations Overview**, you can click an operation in the sidebar to dive into its details.

### Operation details

When you click an operation name, you open detailed information for that operation in the main insights view. This information includes the operation's:

- [**Operation signature**](./operation-signatures)—from this view, you can also:
  - Save the operation to a collection by clicking the save button in the top right corner of the signature.
  - Run the query in Explorer by clicking the play button in the top right corner of the signature.
- [**Query plan**](/federation/query-plans/) as a chart or text—from this view, you can also open the query plan on a separate page to examine it more closely.

To the right of the operation signature and query plan, you can view the operations **usage** and **error** metrics or [**traces**](#resolver-level-traces) by toggling the labels above the operation signature or query plan.

/>

### Resolver-level traces

If you [enable trace reporting](#enabling-traces) in your subgraphs, GraphOS Studio can also display resolver-level trace information about each operation:

<img
  src="../img/traces-tab.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Traces tab for an operation in Apollo Studio"
  width="600"
/>

As shown above, the **Traces** tab for an operation provides a breakdown of timing and error information for _each field_ that's resolved as part of that operation. This helps you identify opportunities to improve your supergraph's overall performance by optimizing whichever resolvers currently act as a bottleneck.

#### Enabling traces

To enable federated trace reporting in your subgraphs, consult the documentation for the GraphQL server library your subgraph uses.

> **Not all subgraph-compatible libraries support federated trace reporting.**
>
> To confirm the support status for your library, check its **FEDERATED TRACING** entry in [Federation-compatible subgraph implementations](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs).

If your subgraphs use [Apollo Server with the `@apollo/subgraph` library](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-subgraph-setup/), federated trace reporting is enabled by default. You can customize Apollo Server's trace reporting behavior with the [inline trace plugin](/apollo-server/api/plugin/inline-trace).

## Request metrics

Directly below the [**Operations Overview**](#operations-overview), you can find the following request metric visualizations:

- A time series chart showing the [**request rate**](#request-rate) in requests per minute (req/min)
- A [**request latency**](#request-latency) graph, generally in milliseconds, seconds, and/or minutes (ms, s, min)
- A [**request latency distribution**](#request-latency-distribution) histogram

### Request rate

  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"
/>

The request rate chart enables you to keep an eye on your supergraph's traffic over time. Abrupt spikes or drops in request rates can highlight potential performance bottlenecks or shifts in user behavior.

Request rate metrics can also help with capacity planning. By tracking request rate trends, you can make informed decisions regarding infrastructure scaling. You can also rely on these graphs for anomaly detection, including identifying issues like DDoS attacks, application errors, or resource constraints.

### Request latency

<img
  src="../img/insights-request-latency.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"
/>

Request latency measures the time it takes for a GraphQL operation to be processed and return a response to the client. Slow operations can lead to sluggish applications and frustrated users.

Request latency metrics provide crucial insights into the performance of various components of your services, such as resolvers, data sources, and third-party services. This data can help you identify areas where optimization is needed.

### Request latency distribution

<img

  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"
/>

The request latency distribution graph illustrates the spread or distribution of your request latencies. This graph can help you identify central tendencies, variability, and patterns in your request latency.

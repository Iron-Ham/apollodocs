Follow this hands-on guide to create a new graph that uses a Dedicated cloud router.

<Tip>

To learn about Dedicated cloud routing in general, go to the [Cloud Dedicated overview](./).

</Tip>

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you must have the following:

- A [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) account
- An organization with the [Dedicated plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/)
  - <TrackableLink href="https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales?referrer=docs" eventName="content_contact_sales">Get in touch</TrackableLink> to request access.
- One or more GraphQL APIs that Apollo can access. That means you must either:
  - Make your GraphQL API(s) available via a publicly accessible URL, for example, `https://api.mycompany.com/subgraphA`
  - Keep your GraphQL API(s) private but allow secure connections, for example, via [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html/)

<Tip>

In a supergraph, each GraphQL API is called a _subgraph_. Apollo refers to these GraphQL APIs as subgraphs, even if you only connect one GraphQL API.

</Tip>

## Step 1. Create a new graph

To provision a new Dedicated cloud router, you must first create a new graph in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content). To do so, click **Create New Graph** from the **Graphs** tab.

## Step 2. Connect APIs

1. Next, connect your GraphQL API to Apollo.
  - If your API URL is publicly accessible, enter the API URL. This URL is the URL that client applications currently use to query your API.
  - If your API isn't publicly accessible and requires private networking, you can connect to it with [AWS VPC Lattice](../lattice). Select **My endpoint isn't publicly accessible** to connect a VPC.

    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated//my-endpoint-not-publicly-accessible.png"
  />

2. Enter a **Subgraph name**. The name should reflect your API's data or capabilities and uniquely identify your API among any other APIs you might add to the supergraph later.

   <Note>

   The subgraph name is immutable.

   </Note>

3. Select the backend **provider** and **region** to deploy your cloud router in.
4. Optionally, configure headers, secrets, CORS rules, or other configurations. You can always [update your router configuration](#step-3-inspect-and-configure-your-cloud-router) as needed.
5. Provide a **Supergraph name** and **ID**.
   - The supergraph name is displayed throughout Studio and helps your team distinguish between your graphs. You can change your graph's name at any time.
   - The ID is immutable and must be unique across all of Apollo. Ensure it starts with a letter and contains only letters, numbers, and dashes. You'll use the ID to reference your graph from various tools, such as the Rover CLI.

6. Click **Create GraphOS Router**.

Provisioning a router for your new supergraph may take a few moments. Once done, click **Query your supergraph** to open the Explorer and begin playing with your graph, or **Open README** to go to your graph's landing page.

Before moving to the next step, add any other GraphQL APIs you want to connect. Open the **Subgraphs** page from the left navigation and click **Add a subgraph**.

/>

Every router configuration or supergraph schema change—including adding a subgraph—triggers a new [launch](/graphos/delivery/launches/). Every launch automatically deploys new cloud router instances for your supergraph.

<Note>

The launch process typically takes 1-2 minutes but may take up to 5 minutes. During the process, Apollo provisions new GCUs and swaps them in once they're online. Deployments minimize API degradation and downtime. 

</Note>

## Step 3. Inspect and configure your cloud router

Dedicated cloud routers have a separate UI for management and configuration. Open the **Cloud Router** page from the left navigation. This page shows a summary of your cloud router, including its **API endpoint** and **API details**.

Use the **Configuration** tab to manage your cloud router's configuration. See the [Apollo Router docs](/router/configuration/overview) for more information.

/>

## Step 4. Test and validate

To test whether your graph works as intended, run a sample query by clicking **Run in Explorer** from your graph's README.

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="The 'Run in Explorer' button in GraphOS Studio"
  src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/run-in-explorer.png"
/>

[Enable subgraph error reporting](./lattice-troubleshooting/#enable-subgraph-error-inclusion) if you run into issues.

For further testing, you can add variants to your graph for different environments. To do so, go to **Settings** > **This Graph** > **Variants** and click **Add a variant**.

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="The 'Add a variant' button in GraphOS Studio"
  src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/add-a-variant.png"
/>

Finally, Apollo recommends running a load test to determine how much [throughput capacity](./throughput) you need to run your graph.

## Step 5. Go live

When you're ready to go live, migrate clients to your router's endpoint. You can find your endpoint URL on the **Cloud router** page in GraphOS Studio.

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="A cloud router's endpoint displayed on the Cloud Router page in GraphOS Studio"
  src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/router-endpoint.png"
/>

Either pass the endpoint directly to your clients or configure a reverse proxy.

<Note>

Support for endpoints with custom domains will become available in 2024.

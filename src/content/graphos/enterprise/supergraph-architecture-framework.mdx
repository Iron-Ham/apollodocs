description: Learn about supergraph best practices and assess your graph's current state
---

Whether your supergraph implementation is already underway or just starting, you can use the [Supergraph Architecture Framework](https://saf.apollographql.com/) (SAF) to learn about best practices.

### SAF Pillars

SAF's principles and best practices are centered around five pillars:

- Operation excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance
- Developer efficiency

### Assess your graph

The SAF includes an assessment you can take to quantify your supergraph's current state and identify areas for improvement in each of these pillars.
